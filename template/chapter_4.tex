\chapter{Preliminary Results/System Prototype}

~~~~The state of the current web-based systems of animal rescue centers are straight-forward and simple. It is important to make it as user-friendly as possible so that it would be easier for the users to engage in the system. But simplicity does not always mean the more users would engage on it. Gamification integrates the “human” to the system and is considered in designing that will motivate more users to take part in using the system.

There are general ways in finding out what motivates the user of an animal rescue center, we then use that motivation to drive the users to do certain actions that they would not normally do. The specific motivation for a web-based animal rescue system that we used is a virtual pet that evolves when it will reach a certain level. The way to gain experience points to level up is by doing actions in a typical animal rescue system like donating, adopting, and volunteering.
