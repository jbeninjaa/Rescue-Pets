\chapter{Research Methodology}

~~~~This chapter discusses the methodologies employed by the researcher in the conduct of the study. These include the design of the study, persons involved, technical and software specifications, user specifications, testing and operation, system implementation, methods, procedure and calendar of activities. 


\section{Research Activities}

\subsection{Design of the Study}
	
~~~~Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the province of Aklan's only animal shelter. This research focuses not only on the development of an animal system, but also on the incorporation of gamification and log-in features to it.

Merriam-Webster defines gamification as the process of incorporating games or game-like elements into something (such as a task) in order to increase participation.[10] Zichermann and Cunningham (2011) believe that this framework for understanding gamification is both powerful and adaptable, as it can be easily applied to any problem that can be solved by influencing human motivation and behavior .[11]

The agile methodology is used by the researchers in the development of the system. Agile Methodology is a practice that promotes continuous testing and development throughout the development lifecycle of the system. In the Agile model of software testing, both development and testing activities are carried out concurrently. It is beneficial because the chosen animal rescue center will be given frequent and early opportunities to inspect the product and make judgments and revisions to the system before it will be implemented. [12]

\subsection{Persons Involved}

~~~~ADVISER. Being the co-author of the study, this person helps and supports the researchers on the duration of the conduct of the study.

RESOURCE PERSON. Representative from Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the resource person to ensure that the system is appropriate for the users and the information is validated from the organization.

PROGRAMMER. The programmer develops the appropriate system to perform methods and generate results in applying the gamification and log-in features.

RESEARCHERS. The researchers perform the handy activities from inquiry, consultation, data gathering, system development, testing until the study is accomplished.

\subsection{Technical and Software Specifications}

~~~~Various software applications to be used for the study are considered during the planning and development phase as conducted by the researchers.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Microsoft Windows 10 for operating system
	\item TexStudio and Microsoft Word for Documentation
	\item Zoom application for consultations and meeting with the adviser
	\item Github 
	\item Adobe XD
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Specifications}

The possible users of the study are the following:

AARRC. The Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the study's primary beneficiary and will also serve as the admin of the system. If implemented, the study, specifically the animal rescue system built, will be of greater assistance to the rescue center in its search for people who want to adopt, volunteer, or donate to the rescue center by posting updates in the system.

AKLANON COMMUNITY. The study, specifically the system, can be used by the Aklanon community to search for pets to adopt. Using the system, the community can also volunteer and donate to the rescue center.

ADVISER. The adviser must be a person of authority having full knowledge on the research problem being conducted. The Adviser guides, supervises and provides meaningful advice to the researchers on the duration of the research activities.

RESEARCHERS. The researchers are the firsthand users and beneficiaries of the study under research. If implemented, the study is attributed to the researcher as the prime mover of engaging to the animal rescue system developed and built. 

\subsection{Testing and operation}

~~~~This is the phase that ensures the system's operability and functionality. Testing is necessary to elicit supplementary details and information to enhance and improve the system. 

People involved in the testing were asked to provide suggestions and recommendations for enhancing and improving the system.

The study is tested by the following users: a) AARRC representative b) researcher’s adviser c) researchers d) developers and e) random users.

\subsection{System Implementation}

~~~~The system's possible implementation, as envisioned by the researchers, is web-based. The mobile development of the system is further pursued based on the researchers' decision or can be done by future researchers who will conduct the same study. Because the study's focus is on the application of gamification and log-in features to the animal rescue system, the study will be implemented after careful and successful testing and operation of the system by domain experts.

\subsection{Methods}
\subsubsection{Federated login}
~~~~The internet is a vast world, and its population of users just grows day-by-day. This is more prevalent as the pandemic caused lockdowns that brought everything online. People create different user accounts, social media, educational sites, lifestyle applications, and many other more. This results in many accounts signing in credentials to remember, and we all know how passwords can be a pain, we just can't help but forget it. Some users may opt to have the same password on multiple different accounts just so that they will not forget it, which is a big security risk. One solution to avoid this problem without sacrificing the safety of the user is by using federated login. Federated login means that the user authenticates by using a third-party service such as Google or Facebook, besides others, and not reentering any credentials or profile information.

\subsubsection{Account Creation}

\subsection{Procedure}
\subsubsection{Integration of Federated login}
~~~~We will use Google sign-in as a federated login tool for the website. According to Google, Google sign-in manages the OAuth 2.0 flow and token lifecycle, simplifying the integration with Google APIs. OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. The steps and guide below will be taken from Google’s own developer website, https://developers.google.com.
First step is to create authorization credentials, any application that uses OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs must have authorization credentials that identify that application to Google’s OAuth Server (Google. (n.d.).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to the Credentials page, \emph{https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials}.
	\item Click \textbf{Create credentials} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{OAuth client ID}.
	\item Select the \textbf{Web application} type.
	\item Name your OAuth 2.0 client and click \textbf{Create}.
	
	~~~~After configuration is complete, take note of the client ID that was created. You will need the client ID to complete the next steps. (A client secret is also created, but you need it only for server-side operations.)
	\item Load the Google Platform Library.
	\item Specify the app’s \textbf{client ID} created for the app in the Google Developers Console with the google signin-client-id meta element.
	\item Add a Google sign-in button, the default Google sign-in button that uses the default setting needs to add a div element with the class g-signin2 in the sign-in page. 
	\item Get profile information by using the getBasicProfile() method.
	
	~~~~Enabling user to sign out of the web app without signing out of Google by adding a sign-out button or link to the web site. To create a sign-out link, attach a function that calls the GoogleAuth.signOut() method to the link’s onclick event.
