\chapter{Research Methodology}

~~~~This chapter discusses the methodologies employed by the researcher in the conduct of the study. These include the design of the study, persons involved, technical and software specifications, user specifications, testing and operation, system implementation, methods, procedure and calendar of activities. 


\section{Research Activities}

\subsection{Design of the Study}
	
~~~~Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the province of Aklan's only animal shelter. This research focuses not only on the development of an animal system, but also on the incorporation of gamification and log-in features to it.

Merriam-Webster defines gamification as the process of incorporating games or game-like elements into something (such as a task) in order to increase participation.[10] Zichermann and Cunningham (2011) believe that this framework for understanding gamification is both powerful and adaptable, as it can be easily applied to any problem that can be solved by influencing human motivation and behavior .[11]

The agile methodology is used by the researchers in the development of the system. Agile Methodology is a practice that promotes continuous testing and development throughout the development lifecycle of the system. In the Agile model of software testing, both development and testing activities are carried out concurrently. It is beneficial because the chosen animal rescue center will be given frequent and early opportunities to inspect the product and make judgments and revisions to the system before it will be implemented. [12]

\subsection{Persons Involved}

~~~~ADVISER. Being the co-author of the study, this person helps and supports the researchers on the duration of the conduct of the study.

RESOURCE PERSON. Representative from Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the resource person to ensure that the system is appropriate for the users and the information is validated from the organization.

PROGRAMMER. The programmer develops the appropriate system to perform methods and generate results in applying the gamification and log-in features.

RESEARCHERS. The researchers perform the handy activities from inquiry, consultation, data gathering, system development, testing until the study is accomplished.

\subsection{Technical and Software Specifications}

~~~~Various software applications to be used for the study are considered during the planning and development phase as conducted by the researchers.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Microsoft Windows 10 for operating system
	\item TexStudio and Microsoft Word for Documentation
	\item Zoom application for consultations and meeting with the adviser
	\item Github 
	\item Firebase
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Specifications}

The possible users of the study are the following:

AARRC. The Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center is the study's primary beneficiary and will also serve as the admin of the system. If implemented, the study, specifically the animal rescue system built, will be of greater assistance to the rescue center in its search for people who want to adopt, volunteer, or donate to the rescue center by posting updates in the system.

AKLANON COMMUNITY. The study, specifically the system, can be used by the Aklanon community to search for pets to adopt. Using the system, the community can also volunteer and donate to the rescue center.

ADVISER. The adviser must be a person of authority having full knowledge on the research problem being conducted. The Adviser guides, supervises and provides meaningful advice to the researchers on the duration of the research activities.

RESEARCHERS. The researchers are the firsthand users and beneficiaries of the study under research. If implemented, the study is attributed to the researcher as the prime mover of engaging to the animal rescue system developed and built. 

\subsection{Testing and operation}

~~~~This is the phase that ensures the system's operability and functionality. Testing is necessary to elicit supplementary details and information to enhance and improve the system. 

People involved in the testing were asked to provide suggestions and recommendations for enhancing and improving the system.

The study is tested by the following users: a) AARRC representative b) researcherâ€™s adviser c) researchers d) developers and e) random users.

\subsection{System Implementation}

~~~~The system's possible implementation, as envisioned by the researchers, is web-based. The mobile development of the system is further pursued based on the researchers' decision or can be done by future researchers who will conduct the same study. Because the study's focus is on the application of gamification and log-in features to the animal rescue system, the study will be implemented after careful and successful testing and operation of the system by domain experts.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsection{Procedure}

The actual activities undertaken based on the methods were:


\section{Calendar of Activities}
