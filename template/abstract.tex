The current available web-based systems are user-friendly because they are simple to use, but they are not particularly interesting and interactive to users. It merely displays basic information and gives a few tasks for the user to complete. Rescue pets: gamification-based animal rescue system of Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center aims to design and develop an animal rescue system that provides better engagement between the stakeholders of the system and the Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center itself by implementing gamification features and applying log-in features in the system being built. Gamification which is the primary feature applied in the study is the process of incorporating gameplay principles and game thinking to increase user engagement and resolve issues. Log-in features were also used to improve user and system engagement by allowing users to log in to their accounts so that transactions made in the system is monitored through users' accounts.
