\section{The Rise of Animal Welfarism}

The 1944 legal reforms were portrayed as a set of rules in the government
proposal response and resolution to a long list of animal-treatment-related issues.
The old anti-cruelty legislation law from 1921 should be replaced with an animal
protection law that provides a comprehensive regulatory framework to set standards
for preventing animal mistreatment in a broader sense. The primary social
function of the old law was to regulate excessive animal use and to police the
borders of animal exploitation. The use of animals had changed and evolved because
of the anti-cruelty regime. Things like the expansion of large-scale breeding
and farming, longer and more frequent animal transports, an increase in the number
of animal experiments, and so on were bound to raise new questions about
the systemic nature of animal abuse and was the real problem that needed to be
addressed (Svard, 2015).

Svard(2015) believes that the 1944 reform’s most important contribution was
not simply expanding legal protection for nonhuman animals, but also bringing
closure and political control to a progressively broken discursive regime. The 1944
reforms achieved what proponents of the current system had fought for in the past:
a fully contextualized problematization that would have been troubled by norms
contradictory to the human-animal relationship[2].

The 1944 reform advocates to broaden the legal protection to animals by
legalizing the punishment to animal abusers. However, the present study focuses
on rescuing and taking care of the stray animals found in the streets by building
a web-based system responsible for these activities.

\section{Philippine Animal Welfare Society}

The organization is dedicated to animal protection and humane treatment.
The organization advocates for the elimination of animal cruelty and pet neglect.
In addition, the organization works to educate and disseminate information about
animal welfare and protection.

People donate cash or in-kind to the organization, they adopt a pet,
and the organization rescues animals and rehabilitates them. The organization
does not accept previously owned pets. Humane education, where educational
tours, interviews, school visits, and seminars are provided for free, spay and neuter
surgeries, where a low-cost clinic is available to the public, animal therapy, and
disaster relief operations are among the other programs offered by the organization[
3].

The organization uses a web-based system to post and record all activities. The
system includes options for adopting, donating, and volunteering. The current
study will also create a system for a local organization concerned with animal
welfare and protection. The Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center has
been chosen as the local organization.

\section{The Albert Foundation}

The Albert Foundation/Stiching Albert is a registered charity in the Netherlands
that collects donations and sponsors the Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and
Rescue Center. It was founded by Michel and Neressa Van Der Kleij. The foundation
has a web-based system in place for AARRC to post information about the
rescue center. The AARRC rescues animals for them to be sponsored or adopted
and live a better life. Most of the animals came from Aklan’s streets, but only
a few came from people who no longer wanted to care for their animals because
dumping animals is strongly discouraged by the center.

Supporting the local community by purchasing and hiring locally is an integral
feature of the AARRC philosophy of ”Animal Welfare Equals Human Welfare.”
We cannot exist without our fellow beings, and they require our assistance. We
start serving the human community by improving public health and safety through
our work with stray animals[4].

The web-based system is simply one in which you do not need to log in because
you can access everything about the AARRC without creating an account. The system contains information about the founder, the mission and vision, the
programs that have been implemented, and instructions on how to donate. Their
email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube accounts are also linked by
the system. The system is available in English, Dutch, and Spanish.

The current study adapt AARRC’s current system while adding new
features such as account creation and having a virtual pet. The current study
adds account creation and gamification features to the system to increase
user engagement. By including account creation, users  were able to create an
account before engaging in any transactions with AARRC. Account creation also
aids in the monitoring of users who have a virtual pet that is automatically gifted
to them after creating an account.

\section{Gamification}

Merriam-Webster defines gamification as the process of incorporating games
or game-like elements into something (such as a task) in order to increase participation.[
7] A study titled ”Does Gamification Work?” was conducted. — A
Literature Review of Empirical Studies on Gamification” (Hamari et al., 2014)
examined 24 scientific studies that shared a high-level research question (not always
clearly stated): Does gamification work? The various studies examined use
a variety of gamification mechanics . According to the findings, the majority of
the studies examined yielded a positive outcome and benefits. It is also important
to note that some of the studies had limitations, such as a limited sample and a
lack of control groups.[7]
Gamification is the method of using gameplay mechanics and game thinking
to user engagement and resolve issues (Cunningham et al., 2011). It is a powerful
tool that encourages players to complete a task or use customer support that they
would not have done normally. Giving users a satisfying and rewarding experience
will not only provide them with entertainment, but will also give people something
to look forward to and encourage them to use the service repeatedly.

Moreover, Zichermann and Cunningham think that the player is the root of
gamification. In a gamified system, the user’s or the player’s motivation to use
the system drives the outcome. Therefore, understanding player motivation is
paramount to building a successfully gamified system (Cunningham et al., 2011).
A good video game values its player more than others, a developer listens to the
opinion of the player of the game and provides patches for the game to be better.
This should also be adapted in any gamified system as it is a powerful tool to gain more engagement and for the long-term success of the system. Predicting how
the “players” of the system would act will allow the builder to reach the main
objectives of the system.[8]

The current study employs gamification features to improve user engagement.
This is done by having a virtual pet after logging in. Each
transaction made by the users equates to a certain number of reward points earned
by the virtual pet. Once the virtual pet has accumulated a certain number of
points, it will level up and change appearance.

\section{Gcash Forest}

Gcash forest is a GCash gamified in-app feature that allows users to plant
virtual trees via the Gcash app. Green Heroes are people who use the Gcash
forest. After three days, the users collect Green Energy, which is then used to
plant trees. Previously, the period for planting trees was only 24 hours.

The feature helps save the environment through the Gcash app, which
has 20 million users. Despite the situation, Martha Sazon, CEO and President
of Gcash, believes that the changes will allow users to plant more trees because
digital transactions are becoming the new norm[5].

According to Anthony Tomas, Mynt CEO, Gcash forest addresses the issue of
citizens who want to help save the environment but don’t know-how. Making a
difference is much easier now that they can plant trees with their smartphones.
The feature is modeled after Alipay Ant Forest, which is run by Ant Financial.
Gcash Forest worked in partnership with the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (DENR), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the Biodiversity
Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). The DENR made available land resources, the
WWF equipped trees and workforce, and BIOFIN provided monitoring expertise
[6].

The present study uses a gamified feature as well, but instead of virtual
trees, a virtual pet is used because the system is for animal rescue. The
Gcash forest harvests green energy, whereas the present study employs digital
points to fund the virtual pet. The virtual pet’s goal is to validate every user’s
help and support in saving and protecting animal strays via the system built.

\section{Automatic Login of Account}

The internet is a vast world, and its user base is growing by the day. This
is more common now that the pandemic has resulted in lockdowns that have
brought everything online. People create various user accounts, social media sites,
educational sites, lifestyle applications, and a variety of other things. As a result,
there are many accounts signing in credentials to remember, and we all know how
passwords can be a pain, and we can’t help but forget them. Some users may
choose to use the same password on multiple accounts in order to avoid forgetting
it, which poses a significant security risk. Using federated login is one way to avoid
this problem without jeopardizing the user’s safety. Federated login means that
the user authenticates by using a third-party service, such as Google or Facebook,
rather than entering credentials or profile information again. [9]

A lot of web-based and even mobile applications make use of account signing.
That’s why we often forget our credentials. The present study makes use of
the automatic log-in of accounts to enable the users to log-in their account easily
without the need to input credentials.
