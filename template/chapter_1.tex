This chapter introduces the study conducted by the researchers. This includes the overview of the current technology, the statement of the problem, general and specific objectives, the scope and limitations of the research, and the significance of the research. 

\section{Overview of the Current State of Technology}
\label{sec:overview}

The Animal Welfare Act (1998), the Wildlife Resources Conservation and
Protection Act (2001), and many supporting Administrative Orders govern many
processes and facilities that affect animal lives in the Philippines, such as farm
animal transport and pet shops. It is recommended that the Philippines’ government
consolidate all animal welfare legislation and jurisdictions into a single
government department with adequate resources for education, enforcement, and
continuing to improve animal welfare. It is also recommended that the government
revise and reassess all Administrative Orders affecting animal welfare to ensure
that they are in line with modern OIE standards and current scientific thinking.
Furthermore, the Philippine government is strongly encouraged to prohibit cruel
practices such as fur farming, keeping wild animals as pets, and long-distance
animal transportation. Additional legal and policy recommendations are linked
to each Animal Protection Index (API) indicator and are included in the relevant
sections of this report \cite{animalprotect00phil}.
   
Many animal rescue centers and organizations are already in place throughout
the country. These animal rescue centers have their own web-based systems that
allow them to operate not only physically, but also virtually. These rescue centers’
web-based systems provide information about the various services they can provide
to rescued animals. The systems allow for online adoption applications, cash or
in-kind donations, and volunteer work at the rescue center. A vision statement,
mission statement, successful projects and programs, contact information, and
social media accounts are some of the information that is also provided in the
system.

\section{Problem Statement}

The animal rescue systems of various animal rescue centers can help in supporting
Administrative Orders that govern many processes and facilities that affect
animal lives in the Philippines by providing web-based systems that assist users or
aspiring pet owners in looking for new homes for pets abandoned by their owners
or pets separated from their family after birth.

The web-based systems currently available are user-friendly because it is simple
to use, but it is not particularly interesting to users. It lacks user engagement
because it only displays basic information and provides a few activities for the
user to do. It is simple to use because there is no need to log in, but it does not
allow you to save the transactions you generate in the system. The study aims to
build a more interactive system by applying gamification and log-in features.

How to formulate your research objectives:
1. Identify what research steps do you need to perform to achieve your general objective.
2. Identify the questions that must be answered for you to achieve your general objective.
    Thereafter, convert these questions into action statements

Example #1:

Research Question:
  What are the general features of a web-based learning environment?

Specific Objective:
   To review existing web-based learning environment that teaches language learning for children


Example #2:

Research Question:
   How will you represent commonsense knowledge for use by computer systems?

Specific Objective:
   To identify knowledge representation approaches used by existing story generation systems

Example #3:
Research Question:
   What types of storytelling knowledge are needed to generate stories?

Specific Objective:
    To identify the different types of storytelling knowledge used in generating stories

Example #4:
Research Question:
    What machine learning approaches will you utilize?

Specific Objective:
    To determine existing machine learning algorithms [that can be used in training the computer system to detect cyberbullying cases] 

Example #5: Research Question:
    How will your research output be evaluated?

Specific Objective:
    To define evaluation metrics for validating the accuracy of the translation

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create an animal rescue system where users can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Donate cash for AARRC;
		\item Adopt available stray animals from AARRC; and
		\item Volunteer work in AARRC.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Create an animal rescue system where the admin can:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Track donations from the users;
		\item Monitor list of adopted animals from AARRC; and
		\item Update volunteer applications for AARRC. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Implement a gamification feature in the system by having a virtual pet that records points for every activity done by the user.
\end{enumerate}
	

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}

The study focuses on designing a system for a local animal rescue center, which
is the Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center. This study focuses on the
application of gamification features to the existing system of the chosen animal
rescue center and allows account creation and automatic log-in when using the
system.

\section{Significance of the Research}
\label{sec:significance}

The study is significant to the following:

AKLAN ANIMAL REHABILITATION AND RESCUE CENTER. This study helps the AARRC provide better services to the public in terms of rescuing,
adopting, and caring for stray animals. This also assists the rescue center in
finding more people willing to help not only these animals, but also other recipients
of the funds collected by the rescue center.

AKLANON COMMUNITY. This study helps in adding a way to improve
pet health in the community of Aklan. This study  assists the Aklanon community
in locating an animal rescue system that cares for their rescued pets.
It also helps them locate rescue organizations when they want to adopt a pet
or make a donation.

PET LOVERS. This study provides satisfaction to pet lovers who want to
adopt pets not only from Aklan but also from nearby places.

COMPUTER SCIENTISTS. This study is an important step toward continuing
to provide information to the public in order to promote the use of gamification
features to increase the level of engagement between a user and a system.

RESEARCHERS. This study serves as baseline data to conduct better research
and build new systems in the future regarding animal rescue systems. Future
researchers will be given the responsibility of improving the present study.
