# RESCUE PETS
- A gamification-based animal rescue system for Aklan Animal Rehabilitation and Rescue Center
- Developed a web application system for an animal rehabilitation and rescue center to provide better engagement by implementing a gamification feature which is a virtual pet that interacts with the transactions of the user.
- Allows the user to create an account and log in using Google’s federated authentication for convenience, gamification is applied in the system by recording the engagement of the user with the system by the use of virtual points. Every transaction made by the user has equivalent virtual points that enable the user’s virtual pets to level up.
